    <h3>Description</h3>
    <h5>This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty,
        made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling.
        A more traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta
        but my mom's recipe calls for a blend of small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan.
        I have found none better anywhere.
        Serve with a leafy green salad and crusty garlic bread.</h5>
